Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, symbolizing a hanging man. The goal for the guesser is to guess the word before the stick figure is fully drawn, while the other player aims to choose a challenging word to stump their opponent. It's a game of wit, vocabulary, and strategy.
